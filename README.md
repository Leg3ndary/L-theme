# Monokai-Dark-Soda

**Install:**

You should just use the built in downloader from replugged, but this also technically works.

```bash
cd replugged/src/Powercord/themes && git clone https://github.com/Leg3ndary/Monokai-Dark-Soda
```

This theme is based on Monokai-Dark-Soda for visual code studio, linked [here](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=AdamCaviness.theme-monokai-dark-soda).
